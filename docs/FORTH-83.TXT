                                1.   FOREWORD


      FORTH is an integrated programming approach and computer
      language.  FORTH was invented by Mr. Charles Moore specifically
      to increase programmer productivity in the development of
      computer related applications without sacrificing machine
      efficiency.  FORTH is a layered environment containing the
      elements of a computer language as well as those of an operating
      system and a machine monitor.  This extensible, layered
      environment provides for highly interactive program development
      and testing.

      In the interests of transportability of application software
      written in FORTH, standardization efforts began in the mid-1970s
      by the European FORTH User's Group (EFUG).  This effort resulted
      in the FORTH-77 Standard.  As the language continued to evolve,
      an interim FORTH-78 Standard was published by the FORTH Standards
      Team.  Following FORTH Standards Team meetings in 1979 the FORTH-
      79 Standard was published in 1980.

      The FORTH Standards Team is comprised of individuals who have a
      great variety of experience and technical expertise with FORTH.
      The FORTH Standards Team consists of both users and implementers.
      Comments, proposals, and correspondence should be mailed to:
      FORTH Standards Team, P.O. Box 4545, Mountain View, CA 94040 USA.

      FORTH's extensibility allows the language to be expanded and
      adapted to special needs and different hardware systems.  A
      programmer or vendor may choose to strictly adhere with the
      standard, but the choice to deviate is acknowledged as beneficial
      and sometimes necessary.  If the standard does not explicitly
      specify a requirement or restriction, a system or application may
      utilize any choice without sacrificing compliance to the standard
      provided that the system or application remains transportable and
      obeys the other requirements of the standard.

                                2.   PURPOSE


      The purpose of this standard is to allow transportability of
      FORTH-83 Standard Programs in source form among FORTH-83 Standard
      Systems.  A standard program shall execute equivalently on all
      standard systems.



                                 3.   SCOPE


      This standard shall apply to any FORTH-83 Standard Program
      executing on any FORTH-83 Standard System, provided sufficient
      computer resources (memory, mass storage) are available.

                               4.   TRADEOFFS


      When conflicting choices are made, the following order guides the
      Standards Team:

      1)   Functional correctness - known bounds, non-ambiguous;

      2)   Portability - repeatable results when programs are
           transported among Standard Systems;

      3)   Simplicity;

      4)   Naming clarity - uniformity of expression using descriptive
           rather than procedure names, i.e., [COMPILE] rather than 'C,
           and ALLOT rather than DP+! ;

      5)   Generality;

      6)   Execution speed;

      7)   Memory compactness;

      8)   Compilation speed;

      9)   Historical continuity;

      10)  Pronounceability;

      11)  Teachability.

                          5.   DEFINITIONS OF TERMS


      These are the definitions of the terms used within this Standard.

      address, byte
           An unsigned 16-bit number that locates an 8-bit byte in a
           standard FORTH address space over the range {0..65,535}.  It
           may be a native machine address or a representation on a
           virtual machine, locating the addr-th byte within the
           virtual byte address space.  Addresses are treated as
           unsigned numbers.  See:  "arithmetic, two's complement"

      address, compilation
           The numerical value compiled for a FORTH word definition
           which identifies that definition.  The address interpreter
           uses this value to locate the machine code corresponding to
           each definition.

      address, native machine
           The natural address representation of the host computer.

      address, parameter field
           The address of the first byte of memory associated with a
           word definition for the storage of compilation addresses (in
           a colon definition), numeric data, text characters, etc.

      arithmetic, two's complement
           Arithmetic is performed using two's complement integers
           within a field of either 16 or 32 bits as indicated by the
           operation.  Addition and subtraction of two's complement
           integers ignore any overflow condition.  This allows numbers
           treated as unsigned to produce the same results as if the
           numbers had been treated as signed.

      block
           The 1024 bytes of data from mass storage which are
           referenced by block numbers in the range {0..the number of
           blocks available -1}.  The actual amount of data transferred
           and the translation from block number to device and physical
           record is a function of the implementation.  See:  "block
           buffer"  "mass storage"

      block buffer
           A 1024-byte memory area where a block is made temporarily
           available for use.  Block buffers are uniquely assigned to
           blocks.  See:  "9.7 Multiprogramming Impact"

      byte
           An assembly of 8 bits.  In reference to memory, it is the
           storage capacity for 8 bits.

      5.   DEFINITIONS OF TERMS


      character
           A 7-bit number the significance of which is given by the
           ASCII standard.  When contained in a larger field, the
           higher order bits are zero.  See:  "6. REFERENCES"

      compilation
           The action of converting text words from the input stream
           into an internal form suitable for later execution.  When in
           the compile state, the compilation addresses of FORTH words
           are compiled into the dictionary for later execution by the
           address interpreter.  Numbers are compiled to be placed on
           the data stack when later executed.  Numbers are accepted
           from the input stream unsigned or negatively signed and
           converted using the value of BASE .  See:  "number"  "number
           conversion"  "interpreter, text"

      defining word
           A word that, when executed, creates a new dictionary entry
           in the compilation vocabulary.  The new word name is taken
           from the input stream.  If the input stream is exhausted
           before the new name is available, an error condition exists.
           Example of defining words are:  :  CONSTANT  CREATE

      definition
           See:  "word definition"

      dictionary
           A structure of word definitions in computer memory which is
           extensible and grows toward higher memory addresses.
           Entries are organized in vocabularies to aid location by
           name.  See:  "search order"

      display
           The process of sending one or more characters to the current
           output device.  These characters are typically displayed or
           printed on a terminal.  The selection of the current output
           device is system dependent.

      division, floored
           Integer division in which the remainder carries the sign of
           the divisor or is zero, and the quotient is rounded to its
           arithmetic floor.  Note that, except for error conditions,
           n1 n2 SWAP OVER /MOD ROT * + is identical to n1.  See:
           "floor, arithmetic"
           Examples:
                dividend  divisor  remainder  quotient
                  10        7        3          1
                 -10        7        4         -2
                  10       -7       -4         -2

      5.   DEFINITIONS OF TERMS


      equivalent execution
           A standard program will produce the same results, exclusive
           of timing dependencies, when given the same inputs on any
           Standard System which has sufficient resources to execute
           the program.  Only standard source programs are
           transportable.

      error condition
           An exceptional condition which requires action by the system
           which may be other than the expected function.  Refer to the
           section "10. Error Conditions".

      false
           A zero number represents the false state of a flag.

      flag
           A number that may have one of two logical states, false or
           true.  See:  "false"  "true"

      floor, arithmetic
           If z is any real number, then the floor of z is the greatest
           integer less than or equal to z.
                The floor of +.6 is 0
                The floor of -.4 is -1

      free field format
           Numbers are converted using the value of BASE and then
           displayed with no leading zeros.  A trailing space is
           displayed.  The number of characters displayed is the
           minimum number of characters, at least one, to uniquely
           represent the number.  See:  "number conversion"

      glossary
           A set of explanations in natural language to describe the
           corresponding computer execution of word definitions.

      immediate word
           A word which executes when encountered during compilation or
           interpretation.  Immediate words handle special cases during
           compilation.  See, for example, IF LITERAL ." etc.

      input stream
           A sequence of characters available to the system, for
           processing by the text interpreter.  The input stream
           conventionally may be taken from the current input device
           (via the text input buffer) and mass storage (via a block
           buffer).  BLK , >IN , TIB and #TIB specify the input stream.
           Words using or altering BLK , >IN , TIB and #TIB are
           responsible for maintaining and restoring control of the
           input stream.







                                      6





      5.   DEFINITIONS OF TERMS


           The input stream extends from the offset value of >IN to the
           size of the input stream.  If BLK is zero the input stream
           is contained within the area addressed by TIB and is #TIB
           bytes long.  If BLK is non-zero the input stream is
           contained within the block buffer specified by BLK and is
           1024 bytes long.   See:  "11.8 Input Text"

      interpreter, address
           The machine code instructions, routine or other facilities
           that execute compiled word definitions containing
           compilation addresses.

      interpreter, text
           The word definitions(s) that repeatedly accepts a word name
           from the input stream, locates the corresponding compilation
           address and starts the address interpreter to execute it.
           Text from the input stream interpreted as a number leaves
           the corresponding value on the data stack.  Numbers are
           accepted from the input stream unsigned or negatively signed
           and converted using the value of BASE .  See:  "number"
           "number conversion"

      layers
           The grouping of word names of each Standard word set to show
           like characteristics.  No implementation requirements are
           implied by this grouping.

      layer, compiler
           Word definitions which add new procedures to the dictionary
           or which aid compilation by adding compilation addresses or
           data structures to the dictionary.

      layer, devices
           Word definitions which allow access to mass storage and
           computer peripheral devices.

      layer, interpreter
           Word definitions which support vocabularies, terminal
           output, and the interpretation of text from the text input
           buffer or a mass storage device by executing the
           corresponding word definitions.

      layer, nucleus
           Word definitions generally defined in machine code that
           control the execution of the fundamental operations of a
           virtual FORTH machine.  This includes the address
           interpreter.

      load
           Redirection of the text interpreter's input stream to be
           from mass storage.  This is the general method for
           compilation of new definitions into the dictionary.

      mass storage
           Storage which might reside outside FORTH's address space.
           Mass storage data is made available in the form of 1024-byte
           blocks.  A block is accessible within the FORTH address
           space in a block buffer.  When a block has been indicated as
           UPDATEed (modified) the block will ultimately be transferred
           to mass storage.

      number
           When values exist within a larger field, the most-
           significant bits are zero.  16-bit numbers are represented
           in memory by addressing the first of two bytes at
           consecutive addresses.  The byte order is unspecified by
           this Standard.  Double numbers are represented on the stack
           with the most-significant 16 bits (with sign) most
           accessible.  Double numbers are represented in memory by two
           consecutive 16-bit numbers.  The address of the least
           significant 16 bits is two greater than the address of the
           most significant 16 bits.  The byte order within each 16-bit
           field is unspecified.  See:  "arithmetic, two's complement"
           "number types" "9.8 Numbers"  "11.7 Stack Parameters"

      number conversion
           Numbers are maintained internally in binary and represented
           externally by using graphic characters within the ASCII
           character set.  Conversion between the internal and external
           forms is performed using the current value of BASE to
           determine the digits of a number.  A digit has a value
           ranging from zero to the value of BASE-1.  The digit with
           the value zero is represented by the ASCII character "0"
           (position 3/0 with the decimal equivalent of 48).  This
           representation of digits proceeds through the ASCII
           character set to the character "(" corresponding to the
           decimal value 9.  For digits with a value exceeding 9, the
           ASCII graphic characters beginning with the character "A"
           (position 4/1 with the decimal equivalent 65) corresponding
           to the decimal value 10 are used.  This sequence then
           continues up to and including the digit with the decimal
           value 71 which is represented by the ASCII character "~"
           (position 7/14 with a decimal equivalent 126).  A negative
           number may be represented by preceding the digits with a
           single leading minus sign, the character "-".

      number types
           All number types consist of some number of bits.  These bits
           are either arbitrary or are weighted.

           Signed and unsigned numbers use weighted bits.  Weighted
           bits within a number have a value of a power of two
           beginning with the rightmost (least-significant) bit having
           the value of two to the zero power.  This weighting
           continues to the leftmost bit increasing the power by one
           for each bit.  For an unsigned number this weighting pattern
           includes the leftmost bit; thus, for an unsigned 16-bit
           number the weight of the leftmost bit is 32,768.  For a
           signed number this weighting pattern includes the leftmost
           bit but the weight of the leftmost bit is negated; thus, for
           a signed 16-bit number the weight of the leftmost bit is
           -32,768.  This weighting pattern for signed numbers is
           called two's complement notation.

           Unspecified weighted numbers are either unsigned numbers or
           signed numbers; program context determines whether the
           number is signed or unsigned.  See:  "11.7 Stack Parameters"

      pictured numeric output
           The use of numeric output definitions which convert
           numerical values into text strings.  These definitions are
           used in a sequence which resembles a symbolic 'picture' of
           the desired text format.  Conversion proceeds from least-
           significant digit to most-significant digit, and converted
           characters are stored from higher memory addresses to lower.

      program
           A complete specification of execution to achieve a specific
           function (application task) expressed in FORTH source code
           form.

      receive
           The process of obtaining one character from the current
           input device.  The selection of the current input device is
           system dependent.

      recursion
           The process of self-reference, either directly or
           indirectly.

      return
           The means of indicating the end of text by striking a key on
           an input device.  The key used is system dependent.  This
           key is typically called "RETURN", "CARRIAGE RETURN", or
           "ENTER".

      screen
           Textual data arranged for editing.  By convention, a screen
           consists of 16 lines (numbered 0 through 15) of 64
           characters each.  Screens usually contain program source
           text, but may be used to view mass storage data.  The first
           byte of a screen occupies the first byte of a mass storage
           block, which is the beginning point for text interpretation
           during a load.

      5.   DEFINITIONS OF TERMS


      search order
           A specification of the order in which selected vocabularies
           in the dictionary are searched.  Execution of a vocabulary
           makes it the first vocabulary in the search order.  The
           dictionary is searched whenever a word is to be located by
           its name.  This order applies to all dictionary searches
           unless otherwise noted.  The search order begins with the
           last vocabulary executed and ends with FORTH , unless
           altered in a system dependent manner.

      source definition
           Text consisting of word names suitable for compilation or
           execution by the text interpreter.  Such text is usually
           arranged in screens and maintained on a mass storage device.

      stack, data
           A last in, first out list consisting of 16-bit binary
           values.  This stack is primarily used to hold intermediate
           values during execution of word definitions.  Stack values
           may represent numbers, characters, addresses, boolean
           values, etc.

           When the name 'stack' is used alone, it implies the data
           stack.

      stack, return
           A last in, first out list which contains the addresses of
           word definitions whose execution has not been completed by
           the address interpreter.  As a word definition passes
           control to another definition, the return point is placed on
           the return stack.

           The return stack may cautiously be used for other values.

      string, counted
           A sequence of consecutive 8-bit bytes located in memory by
           their low memory address.  The byte at this address contains
           a count {0..255} of the number of bytes following which are
           part of the string.  The count does not include the count
           byte itself.  Counted strings usually contain ASCII
           characters.

      string, text
           A sequence of consecutive 8-bit bytes located in memory by
           their low memory address and length in bytes.  Strings
           usually, but not exclusively, contain ASCII characters.
           When the term 'string' is used alone or in conjunction with
           other words it refers to text strings.

      5.   DEFINITIONS OF TERMS


      structure, control
           A group of FORTH words which when executed alter the
           execution sequence.  The group starts and terminates with
           compiler words.  Examples of control structures:  DO ...
           LOOP  DO ... +LOOP  BEGIN ... WHILE ... REPEAT  BEGIN ...
           UNTIL  IF ... THEN  IF ... ELSE ... THEN  See:  "9.9 Control
           Structures"

      transportability
           This term indicates that equivalent execution results when a
           program is executed on other than the system on which it was
           created.  See:  "equivalent execution"

      true
           A non-zero value represents the true state of a flag.  Any
           non-zero value will be accepted by a standard word as
           'true'; all standard words return a 16-bit value with all
           bits set to one when returning a 'true' flag.

      user area
           An area in memory which contains the storage for user
           variable.

      variable, user
           A variable whose data storage area is usually located in the
           user area.  Some system variables are maintained in the user
           area so that the words may be re-entrant to different users.

      vocabulary
           An ordered list of word definitions.  Vocabularies are an
           advantage in separating different word definitions that may
           have the same name.  More than one definition with the same
           name can exist in one vocabulary.  The latter is called a
           redefinition.  The most recently created redefinition will
           be found when the vocabulary is searched.

      vocabulary, compilation
           The vocabulary into which new word definitions are appended.

      word
           A sequence of characters terminated by one blank or the end
           of the input stream.  Leading blanks are ignored.  Words are
           usually obtained via the input stream.

      word definition
           A named FORTH execution procedure compiled into the
           dictionary.  Its execution may be defined in terms of
           machine code, as a sequence of compilation address, or other
           compiled words.

      5.   DEFINITIONS OF TERMS


      word name
           The name of a word definition.  Word names are limited to 31
           characters and may not contain an ASCII space.  If two
           definitions have different word names in the same vocabulary
           they must be uniquely findable when this vocabulary is
           searched.  See:  "vocabulary"  "9.5.3 EXPECT"

      word set
           A named group of FORTH word definitions in the Standard.

      word set, assembler extension
           Additional words which facilitate programming in the native
           machine language of the computer which are by nature system
           dependent.

      word set, double number extension
           Additional words which facilitate manipulation of 32-bit
           numbers.

      word set, required
           The minimum words needed to compile and execute Standard
           Programs.

      word set, system extension
           Additional words which facilitate the access to internal
           system characteristics.

      word, standard
           A named FORTH procedure definition, in the Required word set
           or any extension word sets, formally reviewed and accepted
           by the Standards Team.

      8.   COMPLIANCE AND LABELING




                        8.   COMPLIANCE AND LABELING


      The FORTH Standards Team hereby specifies the requirements for
      labeling of systems and applications so that the conditions for
      program portability may be established.

      A Standard System may use the specified labeling if it complies
      with the terms of this Standard and meets the particular Word Set
      definitions.

      A Standard Program (application) may use the specified labeling
      if it utilizes the specified Standard System according to this
      Standard and executes equivalently on any such system.

      In a system or application, a standard word may not be redefined
      to perform a different function within the vocabulary FORTH.


      FORTH Standard

      A system may be labeled:

           FORTH-83 Standard

      if it includes all of the Required Word Set in either source or
      object form and complies with the text of this Standard.  After
      executing "FORTH-83" the dictionary must contain all of the
      Required Word Set in the vocabulary FORTH, as specified in this
      Standard.


      Standard Sub-set

      A system may be labeled:

           FORTH-83 Standard Sub-set

      if it includes a portion of the Required Word Set and complies
      with the remaining text of this Standard.  However, no Required
      Word may be present with a non-standard definition.


      Standard with Extensions

      A system may be labeled:

           FORTH-83 Standard with <name> Standard Extension(s)

      if it comprises a FORTH-83 Standard System and one or more
      Standard Extension Word Set(s).  For example, a designation would
      be in the form:



                                     16





      8.   COMPLIANCE AND LABELING


           FORTH-83 Standard with Double-Number Standard Extension


      Standard Program

      A FORTH source program which executes equivalently on any
      Standard System may be labeled:

           FORTH-83 Standard Program

      See:  "equivalent execution"  "7. REQUIREMENTS"


      Standard Program with Environmental Dependencies

      A program which is standard in all ways except for specific
      environmentally dependent words may be labeled:

           FORTH-83 Standard Program with Environmental Dependencies

      if the following additional requirements are met:

           1) Environmental dependencies (including hardware
           dependencies) shall be factored into an isolated set of
           application word definitions.

           2) Each environmentally dependent word definition must be
           fully documented, including all dependencies in a manner at
           least as detailed as the standard words.

                                 9.   USAGE



      9.1  Words Names and Word Definitions

      A Standard Program may reference only the definitions of the
      Required Word Set and Standard Extensions and definitions which
      are subsequently defined in terms of these words.  Furthermore, A
      Standard Program must use the standard words as required by any
      conventions of this Standard.  Equivalent execution must result
      from Standard Programs.

      The implementation of a Standard System may use words and
      techniques outside the scope of the Standard, provided that no
      program running on that system is required to use words outside
      the Standard for normal operation.

      If a Standard System or Standard Program redefines Standard
      definitions within the FORTH vocabulary, these definitions must
      comply with the Standard.


      9.2  Addressable Memory

      The FORTH system may share the dictionary space with the user's
      application.  The native addressing protocol of the host computer
      is beyond the scope of this Standard.

      Therefore, in a Standard Program, the user may only operate on
      data which was stored by the application.  No exceptions!

      A Standard Program may address:

      1.   parameter fields of words created with CREATE , VARIABLE ,
           and user defined words which execute CREATE ;

      2.   dictionary space ALLOTted;

      3.   data in a valid mass storage block buffer.
           See:  "9.7 Multiprogramming Impact";

      4.   data area of user variables;

      5.   text input buffer and PAD up to the amount specified as the
           minimum for each area.

      A Standard Program may NOT address:

      1.   directly into the data or return stacks;

      2.   into a definition's name field, link field, or code field;



                                     18





      9.   USAGE


      3.   into a definition's parameter field if not stored by the
           application.


      9.3  Return Stack

      A Standard Program may cautiously use the return stack with the
      following restrictions:

      The return stack may not be accessed inside a do-loop for values
      placed on the return stack before the loop was entered.  Further,
      neither I nor J may be used to obtain the index of a loop if
      values are placed and remain on the return stack within the loop.
      When the do-loop is executed all values placed on the return
      stack within that loop must be removed before LOOP , +LOOP , or
      LEAVE is executed.  Similarly, all values placed on the return
      stack within a colon definition must be removed before the colon
      definition is terminated at ; or before EXIT is executed.


      9.4  Compilation

      The system uses the return stack and the dictionary in a system
      dependent manner during the compilation of colon definitions.
      Some words use the data stack in a system dependent manner during
      compilation.  See:  "sys (11.7)"


      9.5  Terminal Input and Output


      9.5.1     KEY

      A Standard System must receive all valid ASCII characters.  Each
      KEY receives one ASCII character, with more-significant bits
      environmentally dependent and might be zero.  KEY must receive as
      many bits as are obtainable.  A Standard Program without
      environmental dependencies may only use the least significant 7-
      bit ASCII character received by KEY .  For example:  KEY 127 AND


      9.5.2     EXPECT

      Control characters may be processed to allow system dependent
      editing of the characters prior to receipt.  Therefore, a
      Standard Program may not anticipated that control characters can
      be received.

      9.   USAGE


      9.5.3     EMIT

      Because of the potential non-transportable action by terminal
      devices of control characters, the use of ASCII control
      characters is an environmental dependency.  Each EMIT deals with
      only one ASCII character.  The ASCII character occupies the
      least-significant 7 bits; the more-significant bits may be
      environmentally dependent.  Using the more-significant bits when
      other than zero is an environmentally dependent usage.  EMIT must
      display as many bits as can be sent.


      9.5.4     TYPE

      Because of the potential non-transportable action by terminal
      devices of control characters, the use of ASCII control
      characters is an environmental dependency.


      9.6  Transporting Programs Between Standard Systems

      Further usage requirements are expected to be added for
      transporting programs between Standard Systems.


      9.7  Multiprogramming Impact

      In a multiprogrammed system, Device Layer words and those words
      which implicitly reference the Device Layer words may relinquish
      control of the processor to other tasks.  Although there is
      insufficient experience to specify a standard for
      multiprogramming, historical usage dictates that a programmer be
      aware of the potential impact with regard to resources shared
      between tasks.  The only shared resources specified within the
      Standard are block buffers.  Therefore the address of a block
      buffer returned by BLOCK or BUFFER becomes invalid during and
      after the execution of any word marked by the attribute M in the
      glossary or any words executing them.  A block buffer is valid
      only if its address is valid.  See:  "11.4 Attributes"


      9.8  Numbers

      Interpreted or compiled numbers are in the range
      {-32,768..65,535}.  See:  "number conversion"


      9.9  Control Structures

      Control structures are compiled inside colon definitions.
      Control structures can be nested but cannot overlap.  For
      additional limitations see DO .

      10.1 Possible Actions on an Error

      When an error condition occurs, a Standard System may take one or
      more of the following actions:

      1.   ignore and continue;

      2.   display a message;

      3.   execute a particular word;

      4.   set interpret state and interpret a block;

      5.   set interpret state and begin interpretation;

      6.   other system dependent actions.

      See:  "7.1 Documentation Requirements"


      10.2 General Error Conditions

      The following error conditions apply in many situations.  These
      error conditions are listed below, but may occur at various times
      and with various words.

      1.   input stream exhausted before encountering a required <name>
           or delimiting character;

      2.   insufficient stack space or insufficient number of stack
           entries during text interpretation or compilation;

      3.   a word not found and not a valid number, during text
           interpretation or compilation;

      4.   compilation of incorrectly nested control structures;

      5.   execution of words restricted to compilation only, when not
           in the compile state and while not compiling a colon
           definition;

      6.   FORGETting within the system to a point that removes a word
           required for correct execution;

      7.   insufficient space remaining in the dictionary;

      8.   a stack parameter out of range, e.g., a negative number when
           a +n was specified in the glossary;

      11.1 Order

      The glossary definitions are listed in ASCII alphabetical order.


      11.2 Capitalization

      Word names are capitalized throughout this Standard.


      11.3 Stack Notation

      The stack parameters input to and output from a definition are
      described using the notation:

           before -- after

                before    stack parameters before execution
                after     stack parameters after execution

      In this notation, the top of the stack is to the right.  Words
      may also be shown in context when appropriate.

      Unless otherwise noted, all stack notation describes exectution
      time.  If it applies at compile time, the line is followed by:
      (compiling) .


      11.4 Attributes

      Capitalized symbols indicate attributes of the defined words:

      C    The word may only be used during compilation of a colon
           definition.

      I    Indicates that the word is IMMEDIATE and will execute during
           compilation, unless special action is taken.

      M    This word has a potential multiprogramming impact.
           See:  "9.7 Multiprogramming Impact"

      U    A user variable.

      11.5 Serial Numbers

      When a substantive alteration to a word's definition is made or
      when a new word is added, the serial number will be the last two
      digits of the year of the Standard in which such change was made
      (i.e., "83").  When such change is made within a Working Draft,
      the number will be suffixed with the character identifying the
      draft (i.e., "83A").


      11.6 Pronunciation

      The natural language pronunciation of word names is given in
      double quotes (") where it differs from English pronunciation.


      11.7 Stack Parameters

      Unless otherwise stated, all references to numbers apply to 16-
      bit signed integers.  The implied range of values is shown as
      {from..to}.  The contents of an address is shown by double
      braces, particularly for the contents of variables, i.e., BASE
      {{2..72}}.

      The following are the stack parameter abbreviations and types of
      numbers used throughout the glossary.  These abbreviations may be
      suffixed with a digit to differentiate multiple parameters of the
      same type.

      Any other symbol refers to an arbitrary signed 16-bit integer in
      the range {-32,768..32,767}, unless otherwise noted.

      Because of the use of two's complement arithmetic, the signed 16-
      bit number (n) -1 has the same bit representation as the unsigned
      number (u) 65,535.  Both of these numbers are within the set of
      unspecified weighted numbers (w).  See:  "arithmetic, two's
      complement"  "number"  "number types"  "stack, data"

      ccc
           A sequence of arbitrary characters accepted from the input
           stream until the first occurrence of the specified
           delimiting character.  The delimiter is accepted from the
           input stream, but is not one of the characters ccc and is
           therefore not otherwise processed.  This notation refers to
           text from the input stream, not to values on the data stack.
           Unless noted otherwise, the number of characters accepted
           may be from 0 to 255.  See:  "10.2 General Error Conditions"

      BLOCK        u -- addr                     M,83
           addr is the address of the assigned buffer of the first byte
           of block u.  If the block occupying that buffer is not block
           u and has been UPDATEed it is transferred to mass storage
           before assigning the buffer.  If block u is not already in
           memory, it is transferred from mass storage into an assigned
           block buffer.  A block may not be assigned to more than one
           buffer.  If u is not an available block number, an error
           condition exists.  Only data within the last buffer
           referenced by BLOCK or BUFFER is valid.  The contents of a
           block buffer must not be changed unless the change may be
           transferred to mass storage.

      BUFFER       u -- addr                     M,83

           by moving the byte at (addr1 plus u minus 1) to (addr2 plus
           u minus 1) and proceeds to successively lower addresses for
           u bytes.  If u is zero nothing is moved.  (Useful for

      WORD         char -- addr                  M,83
           Generates a counted string by non-destructively accepting
           characters from the input stream until the delimiting
           character char is encountered or the input stream is
           exhausted.  Leading delimiters are ignored.  The entire
           character string is stored in memory beginning at addr as a
           sequence of bytes.  The string is followed by a blank which
           is not included in the count.  The first byte of the string
           is the number of characters {0..255}.  If the string is
           longer than 255 characters, the count is unspecified.  If
           the input stream is already exhausted as WORD is called,
           then a zero length character string will result.

           If the delimiter is not found the value of >IN is the size
           of the input stream.  If the delimiter is found >IN is
           adjusted to indicate the offset to the character following
           the delimiter.  #TIB is unmodified.

           The counted string returned by WORD may reside in the "free"
           dictionary area at HERE or above.  Note that the text

      After BRANCH or ?BRANCH is compiled, >MARK or <RESOLVE is
      executed.  The addr left by >MARK is passed to >RESOLVE .  The
      addr left by <MARK is passed to <RESOLVE .  For example:
           : IF     COMPILE ?BRANCH  >MARK  ; IMMEDIATE
           : THEN   >RESOLVE  ; IMMEDIATE

      <MARK        -- addr                       C,83   "backward-mark"
           Used at the destination of a backward branch.  addr is
           typically only used by <RESOLVE to compile a branch address.

      <RESOLVE     addr --                      C,83 "backward-resolve"
           Used at the source of a backward branch after either BRANCH
           or ?BRANCH .  Compiles a branch address using addr as the
           destination address.

      >MARK        -- addr                       C,83    "forward-mark"
           Used at the source of a forward branch.  Typically used
           after either BRANCH or ?BRANCH .  Compiles space in the
           dictionary for a branch address which will later be resolved
           by >RESOLVE .

      >RESOLVE     addr --                       C,83 "forward-resolve"
           Used at the destination of a forward branch.  Calculates the
           branch address (to the current location in the dictionary)
           using addr and places this branch address into the space
           left by >MARK .

      ?BRANCH      flag --                       C,83 "question-branch"
           When used in the form:  COMPILE ?BRANCH  a conditional
           branch operation is compiled.  See BRANCH for further
           details.  When executed, if flag is false the branch is
           performed as with BRANCH .  When flag is true execution
           continues at the compilation address immediately following
           the branch address.

      BRANCH       --                            C,83
           When used in the form:  COMPILE BRANCH  an unconditional
           branch operation is compiled.  A branch address must be
           compiled immediately following this compilation address.
           The branch address is typically generated by following
           BRANCH with <RESOLVE or >MARK .

      The Controlled Reference Words are word definitions which,
      although not required, cannot be present with a non-standard
      definition in the vocabulary FORTH of a Standard System.  These
      words have present usage and/or are candidates for future
      standardization.

           n is converted using BASE and then displayed right aligned
           in a field +n characters wide.  A leading minus sign is
           displayed if n is negative.  If the number of characters
           required to display n is greater than +n, an error condition
           exists.  See:  "number conversion"

           List the contents of u addresses starting at addr.  Each
           line of values may be preceded by the address of the first
           value.

      EDITOR       --                            83
           Execution replaces the first vocabulary in the search order

      The Uncontrolled Reference Word Set contains glossary definitions
      which are included for public reference of words that have past
      or present usage and/or are candidates for future
      standardization.  No recommendation is made that these words be
      included in a system.

      No restrictions are placed on the definition or usage of
      uncontrolled words.  However, use of these names for procedures
      differing from the given definitions is discouraged.

           Used in the form:
                   -' <name>
           Leave the parameter field of <name> beneath zero (false) if
           <name> can be found in the search order; leave only true if
           not found.

      -MATCH       addr1 +n1 addr2 +n2 -- addr3 flag       "dash-match"
           Attempt to find the +n2-length text string beginning at
           addr2 somewhere in the +n1-length text string beginning at
           addr1.  Return the last+1 address addr3 of the match point
           and a flag which is zero if a match exists.

      -TEXT        addr1 +n1 addr2 -- n2                    "dash-text"
           Compare two strings over the length +n1 beginning at addr1

                   sys --   (compiling)
           A do-loop terminating word.  The loop index is incremented
           by the positive value +n.  If the unsigned magnitude of the
           resultant index is greater than the limit, then the loop is
           terminated, otherwise execution returns to the corresponding
           DO .  The comparison is unsigned magnitude.  sys is balanced
           with its corresponding DO .  See:  DO

      1+!          addr --                             "one-plus-store"

           Subtract one from the 16-bit contents at addr.

      ;:           -- addr                       C,I "semi-colon-colon"
           Used to specify a new defining word:
                   : <namex> ... ;: ... ;
           and then
                   <namex> <name>
           When <namex> is executed, it creates an entry for the new
           word <name>.  Later execution of <name> will execute the
           sequence of words between ;: and ; , with the address of the
           first (if any) parameters associated with <name> on the
           stack.

      ;S           --                           Interpret only "semi-s"

           form:
                   : <namex> ... <BUILDS ... DOES> ... ;
           and then
                   <namex> <name>
           When <namex> executes, <BUILDS creates a dictionary entry
           for the new <name>.  The sequence of words between <BUILDS
           and DOES> established a parameter field for <name>.  When
           <name> is later executed, the sequence of words following
           DOES> will be executed, with the parameter field address of
           <name> on the data stack.

           interpreting, char is left on the stack.  If compiling,
           compile char as a literal so that when the colon definition
           is later executed, char is left on the stack.

      1  INTRODUCTION

           The method of selecting the order in which the dictionary is
      searched has grown from unchained vocabularies to the present use
      of chained vocabularies.  Many techniques are in use for
      specification of the sequence in which multiple vocabularies may
      be searched.  In order to offer generality and yet get precision
      in specification, this proposal is offered.


      2  DESCRIPTION

      The following functions are required:

      1.   Two search orders exist.  CONTEXT is the group of
           vocabularies searched during interpretation of text from the
           input stream.  CURRENT is the single vocabulary into which
           new definitions are compiled, and from which FORGET
           operates.

      2.   Empty CONTEXT to a minimum number of system words.  These
           are just the words to further specify the search order.

      3.   Add individual vocabularies into CONTEXT.  The most recently
           added is searched first.

      4.   Specify which single vocabulary will become CURRENT.

           The following optional functions aid the user:

      1.   Display the word names of the first vocabulary in the
           CONTEXT search order.

      2.   Display the vocabulary names comprising CURRENT and CONTEXT
           search orders.

      C.  EXPERIMENTAL PROPOSALS


      3  ADVANTAGES

           Use over the past year has demonstrated that the proposed
      methods may emulate the vocabulary selection of all other
      systems.  The order is explicit by execution, may be interpreted
      and compiled, and is obvious from the declaration.  The search
      order is specified at run-time rather than the time a new
      vocabulary is created.


      4  DISADVANTAGES

           By migrating to a common structure, vendors give up one
      point at which they may claim their product is better than
      others.  Another drawback is that the number of CONTEXT
      vocabularies is fixed; older methods had an indefinite 'tree'
      structure.  In practice, the branching of such a structure was
      very rarely greater than four.

           Forth words operate in a context sensitive environment, as
      word names may be redefined and have different definitions in
      different vocabularies.  This proposal compounds the problem.  By
      displaying the search order names, the user at least can readily
      verify the search order.


      5  IMPACT

           The text of the Forth 83 Standard has been carefully chosen
      for consistency and generality.  However, no specification on how
      the search order is developed by the user is given.  This
      omission is unavoidable, due to the diversity of contemporary
      practice.  This proposal is intended to complete the Forth 83
      requirements in a fashion that exceeds all other methods.

           Previously standardized words continue in their use:
      VOCABULARY, FORTH, DEFINITIONS, and FORGET.  However, this
      proposal assumes that vocabulary names are not IMMEDIATE .


      6  DEFINITIONS

      Search order:
           The sequence in which vocabularies are selected when
           locating a word by name in the dictionary.  Consists of one
           transient and up to three resident vocabularies.

      Transient order:
           Execution of any vocabulary makes it the first vocabulary
           searched, replacing the previously selected transient
           vocabulary.

      C.  EXPERIMENTAL PROPOSALS


      Resident order:
           After searching the transient order, up to three additional
           vocabularies may be searched.  The application program
           controls this selection.


      7  GLOSSARY

      ONLY         --                            ONLY
           Select just the ONLY vocabulary as both the transient
           vocabulary and resident vocabulary in the search order.

      FORTH        --                            ONLY
           The name of the primary vocabulary.  Execution makes FORTH
           the transient vocabulary, the first in the search order, and
           thus replaces the previous transient vocabulary.

      ALSO         --                            ONLY
           The transient vocabulary becomes the first vocabulary in the
           resident portion of the search order.  Up to the last two
           resident vocabularies will also be reserved, in order,
           forming the resident search order.

      ORDER        --                            ONLY
           Display the vocabulary names forming the search order in
           their present search order sequence.  Then show the
           vocabulary into which new definitions will be placed.

      WORDS        --                            ONLY
           Display the word names in the transient vocabulary, starting
           with the most recent definition.

      FORGET       --                            ONLY
           Used in the form:
                   FORGET <name>
           Delete from the dictionary <name> and all words added to the
           dictionary after <name> regardless of the vocabulary.
           Failure to find <name> is an error condition.  An error
           condition also exists upon implicitly forgetting a
           vocabulary (due to its definition after <name>).

      DEFINITIONS  --                            ONLY
           Select the transient vocabulary as the current vocabulary
           into which subsequent definitions will be added.

      SEAL         --                            ONLY
           Delete all occurances of ONLY from the search order.  The
           effect is that only specified application vocabularies will
           be searched.

                DEFINITION FIELD ADDRESS CONVERSION OPERATORS


                                     by

                                Kim R. Harris


      A.  INTRODUCTION

      The standard provides a transportable way to obtain the
      compilation address of a definition in the dictionary of a FORTH
      system (cf., FIND and ' ).  It also provides an operator to
      convert a compilation address to its corresponding parameter
      field address.  However, the standard does not provide a
      transportable way to convert either of these addresses to the
      other fields of a definition.  Since various FORTH
      implementations have different dictionary structures, a standard
      set of conversion operators would increase transportability and
      readability.

      A set of words is proposed which allows the conversion of any
      definitions field address to any other.


      B.  GLOSSARY

      In the following words, the compilation address is either the
      source or the destination, so it is not indicated in the names.

      >BODY        addr1 -- addr2                             "to-body"
           addr2 is the parameter field address corresponding to the
           compilation address addr1.

      >NAME        addr1 -- addr2                             "to-name"
           addr2 is the name field address corresponding to the
           compilation address addr1.

      >LINK        addr1 -- addr2                             "to-link"
           addr2 is the link field address corresponding to the
           compilation address addr1.

      BODY>        addr1 -- addr2                           "from-body"
           addr2 is the compilation address corresponding to the
           parameter field address addr1.

      NAME>        addr1 -- addr2                           "from-name"
           addr2 is the compilation address corresponding to the name
           field address addr1.




                                     71





      C.  EXPERIMENTAL PROPOSALS


      LINK>        addr1 -- addr2                           "from-link"
           addr2 is the compilation address corresponding to the link
           field address addr1.

      The previous set of words is complete, but may be inefficient for
      going between two fields when one is not the compilation address.
      For greater efficiency, additional operators may be defined which
      name both the source and destination fields.

      N>LINK       addr1 -- addr2                        "name-to-link"
           addr2 is the link field address corresponding to the name
           field address addr1.

      L>NAME       addr1 -- addr2                        "link-to-name"
           addr2 is the name field address corresponding to the link
           field address addr1.


      C.  DISCUSSION

      The previous words provide a complete, consistent, and efficient
      set of definition field address conversion operations.  They can
      be implemented in a FORTH system which uses any combination of
      the following options for its dictionary structure:

           Link fields first or second.
           Fixed or variable length name fields.
           Additional fields in the definitions structure.

           Heads contiguous or separated from bodies.

           Indirect, direct, subroutine, or token threaded code.

      The words are compatible with this standard; their inclusion
      would not require other changes to be made to the standard.

      Disadvantages to including them in the standard include:

           They add 6 to 8 more words to the standard.

           A standard program may not use all of them since it is not
           allowed to access the name or link fields.  However, this
           does not disqualify them from being in the standard.

           If a definition's head is not in the dictionary, an error
           condition would exist.  In this case, what action should the
           words take in an implemented system?

      The author of this experimental proposal recommends that FORTH
      system implementors try them and that they be included in the
      System Word Set of the next FORTH standard.

      D.  SOURCE CODE EXAMPLE

      High level source code is shown below for a very simple
      dictionary structure.  This code assumes a FORTH system which
      uses indirect threaded code, heads contiguous to bodies, and a
      definition structure of the following format:

           Name field, 4 bytes long, fixed length.
           Link field, 2 bytes long.
           Code field, 2 bytes long.
           Parameter field, variable length.

      : >BODY   ( acf -- apf )  2+  ;
      : BODY>   ( apf -- acf )  2-  ;
      : >LINK   ( acf -- alf )  2-  ;
      : LINK>   ( alf -- acf )  2-  ;
      : >NAME   ( acf -- anf )  6 - ;
      : NAME>   ( anf -- alf )  6 + ;
      : N>LINK  ( anf -- alf )  4 + ;
      : L>NAME  ( alf -- anf )  4 - ;

      No examples are given because their use should be obvious.

      1.  Purpose and Goals


      1.1  Purpose

           1.1.1  This Charter establishes and guides a voluntary
           membership professional organization, the FORTH Standards
           Team (hereafter referred to as the "FST") and provides a
           method for its operation.


      1.2  Goals

           1.2.1  The goal of the FST is the creation, maintenance, and
           proliferation of a standard (hereafter referred to as the
           "Standard") for the FORTH computer programming system and
           for application programs executed by a Standard system.  The
           Standard shall specify requirements and constraints which
           such computer software must satisfy.

           1.2.2  The team shall also develop a method of
           identification and labeling of FORTH implementations and
           programs which conform to the Standard.


      1.3  Organization

           1.3.1  The FST is a voluntary membership organization with
           no formal status as a legal entity.  It operates by
           consensus of the professional and commercial FORTH community
           and conducts business by the professional discourse and
           agreement of its members.  It is intended that this Charter
           be a guide to the operation of the FST subject to reasonable
           minor digression, rather than being a rigid document under
           which vested rights are granted.

      D.  CHARTER


      2.  METHODS


      2.1  Formal Meetings

           2.1.1  The FST shall hold periodic formal meetings for
           discussion and decisions concerning a current or future
           Standard.

           2.1.2  There is not specified frequency for formal meetings.
           Each meeting shall be at such time and place as was decided
           at the prior meeting.  If a meeting cannot be held as
           decided, the Chairperson may designate another time and
           place.

           2.1.3  The Chairperson shall send a written notice at least
           sixty (60) days in advance of each formal meeting to each
           voting member.  A longer notification period is recommended.
           It is anticipated that the continuing close coordination of
           the participants, the decision at the prior formal meeting,
           and publication of a meeting notice in FORTH Dimensions and
           other trade journals will provide sufficient notice to the
           FORTH community.

           2.1.4  At a formal FST meeting, there shall be general
           sessions consisting of all attendees.  General sessions are
           for matters that are ready for discussion and decision.  All
           votes concerning the Standard, Charter, or FST procedures
           must take place during a general session.

           2.1.5  Also at formal meetings, subteams will be established
           to examine groups of proposals and to prepare
           recommendations for a general session.  All meeting
           attendees may participate in the work and voting of a
           subteam.  Each subteam should elect from its members a
           coordinator to conduct its meetings and a reporter to record
           and report its recommendations.

           2.1.6  The Chairperson may publish and distribute an agenda
           at or in advance of a formal meeting.  As a guideline, each
           day of a formal meeting begins with a general session,
           followed by concurrent subteam meetings followed by another
           general session.

           2.1.7  In view of the voluntary nature of the FST, at least
           one third of the membership is required to hold a formal
           meeting.  Two thirds of the number of voting members present
           at the start of each day's first general session shall set
           the quorum for the remainder of that day.








                                     75





      D.  CHARTER


           2.1.8  Between formal meetings, the Chairperson may appoint
           such informal working groups as is appropriate.  Each group
           may be given a goal and scope to direct its activities.  Its
           conclusions or recommendations must be given to the
           Chairperson in written form.


      2.2  Proposals and Comments

           2.2.1  Prior to each formal meeting, the Chairperson may
           solicit submission of comments and proposals for changes,
           additions, or deletions to the then-current Standard, the
           draft Standard or this Charter.  A cutoff date may be
           specified for the submission of such proposals.

           2.2.2  A considerable amount of information must accompany
           each proposal to help FST members analyze the proposal.
           Therefore, submission of proposals and comments shall be
           according to the format and instructions shown in the
           "Proposal/Comment Form" included as an Appendix to this
           Standard.  Any proposal not in the appropriate form or
           received after the cutoff date may not be considered unless
           the Chairperson deems it to be of sufficient significance.

           2.2.3  Unsolicited proposals and comments by volunteers are
           acknowledged as valuable.  Any individual or group may
           submit proposals and/or comments concerning the Standard or
           this Charter.  These should be sent to the official address
           of the FST.  Properly formatted proposals and comments are
           preferred.  The author or a representative should plan to
           attend the next formal meeting to emphasize, support, and
           possibly modify the proposals.

           2.2.4  Since the quantity of proposals and comments may
           exceed the number for which there is time to be voted upon,
           submission of a proposal does not automatically mean that it
           will be voted upon at the next formal FST meeting.  The
           Chairperson or some members appointed by the Chairperson or
           elected by the voting members may screen and organize the
           received proposals and comments for voting upon at the next
           formal meeting.

           2.2.5  To allow reflection and examination, proposals and
           comments shall be distributed to FST voting members and
           sponsors in advance of a formal meeting.  Proposals and
           comments not distributed in advance, including proposals
           made during a formal meeting, may be considered at the
           discretion of the Chairperson.

      2.3  Draft Standard

           After a formal meeting, the referees and officers of the FST
           shall prepare a draft Standard for review by the then-
           current FST voting members.  The referees and officers shall
           consolidate proposals accepted by vote during the meeting,
           resolve any ambiguities or problems, and incorporate these
           changes with the text of the previous Standard or draft
           Standard.


      2.4  Standard

           2.4.1  The referees and officers may, by near unanimous
           decision (not more than one no vote), declare the draft
           Standard, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, as being
           the proposed Standard.

           2.4.2  A proposed Standard shall be distributed to all FST
           voting members for a mail ballot.  This ballot shall be
           based solely on the text of the proposed Standard as
           distributed.

           2.4.3  Each ballot returned shall be signed by the voting
           member submitting it.  An affirmative vote of at least two
           thirds of the voting members shall adopt the document.  Such
           adoption makes the draft Standard the current, official FST
           Standard which supersedes all prior Standards.


      2.5  Charter

           2.5.1  At a formal FST meeting, the charter may be amended
           by a simple majority of voting members present provided that
           at least one third of all voting members are present; such
           amendments become effective at the end of the current formal
           meeting.

           2.5.2  At other than a formal FST meeting, the charter may
           be amended by a simple majority of all voting members, such
           vote to be taken by signed mail ballots.

      3.  MEMBERSHIP


      3.1  General

           Membership in the FST is a privilege, not a right.  An
           invitation for voting membership may be extended to those
           who the FST feels can contribute to the goals of the
           Standard and the FST.  There are several classes of
           participation in the efforts of the FST.  Membership in each
           class has no specified term but continues from the time when
           membership is initiated to the conclusion of the next formal
           meeting.


      3.2  Voting Members

           3.2.1  Voting members are individuals who are elected into
           such membership at the concluding session of a formal FST
           meeting.  Any voting member who resigns between formal
           meetings shall not be replaced until the membership
           elections at the conclusion of the next formal meeting.  A
           newly elected voting member gains voting rights only after
           all voting members have been elected.  A significant
           professional FORTH background is required of voting members.

           3.2.2  Each voting member present at a formal meeting shall
           indicate in writing his or her desire to continue as a
           voting member.  Only these voting members can vote in a
           general session of a formal meeting on any matters affecting
           the Standard or the Charter and on the election of all
           voting members.

           3.2.3  Voting members are elected by a simple majority of
           those voting members present.  The number of voting members
           shall be limited to thirty (30).  Individuals eligible to be
           elected are selected from each of the following ordered
           categories in order, until the number of voting members
           reaches the limit.

                3.2.3.1  Category 1:  current voting member who have
                actively participated in at least two days of a formal
                meeting.  Voting members are expected to actively
                participate in subteam meetings and all general
                sessions.

                3.2.3.2  Category 2:  current voting members who are
                not eligible by Category 1, but who have requested in
                writing that his or her voting membership be
                maintained.

                3.2.3.3  Category 3:  eligible candidates.  Eligible
                candidates will be presented to the voting members then
                elected as follows:



                                     78





      D.  CHARTER


                     3.2.3.3.1  If the number of eligible candidates
                     does not exceed the number of openings for voting
                     membership, each candidate is voted upon and
                     accepted by a simple majority.

                     3.2.3.3.2  If the number of eligible candidates
                     does exceed the number of openings for voting
                     membership, candidates will be voted upon by
                     ballot whereby each voting member may vote for up
                     to the number of openings remaining.  Those
                     candidates receiving the most votes will be
                     elected until there are no more openings for
                     voting membership.


      3.3  Candidates

           3.3.1  Candidates are individuals who desire to actively
           participate in and support the FST by becoming voting
           members.

           3.3.2  To be eligible, each Candidate must:  declare in
           writing to the secretary at the first general session of a
           formal FST meeting that he or she is a Candidate, actively
           participate in subteam meetings and all general sessions at
           a formal FST meeting, and have a significant professional
           background in FORTH.  The Chairperson may request
           information or ask questions of any candidate to determine
           his or her technical knowledge and experience.  Candidates
           are expected to submit proposals, participate in the
           discussions of the formal meeting, and contribute to the
           work and voting of subteams.


      3.4  Observers

           3.4.1  Observers are individuals who attend a formal meeting
           but are neither voting members nor candidates.  At the
           discretion of the Chairperson, they may contribute to the
           discussion at general sessions and to the work of subteams.
           The number of observers allowed at a formal meeting may be
           limited by the Chairperson.


      3.5  FST Sponsors

           3.5.1  FST sponsors are individuals or organizations who
           contribute funds and other assistance to aid the work of the
           FST.  FST sponsors have no duties or responsibilities in the
           FST, but they will receive copies of proposals and comments
           considered at a formal meeting, and drafts and adopted
           standards prepared as a result of that meeting.





                                     79





      D.  CHARTER


           3.5.2  FST sponsorship exists from the end of one formal
           meeting to the end of the next formal meeting.

           3.5.3  Qualification of FST sponsors may be determined by a
           simple majority vote at a formal FST meeting.  If no such
           qualification exist, the Chairperson may specify
           qualifications, including the amount of financial
           contributions, which will remain in effect until the next
           formal FST meeting.


      4.  OFFICERS


      4.1  General

           There shall be four types of elected officers of the FST:
           the Chairperson, the Secretary, the Treasurer, and one or
           more Referees.  Each officer shall be elected at a formal
           meeting of the FST and serve until the next formal meeting.


      4.2  Vacancies

           If any office other than the Chairperson becomes vacant
           between formal meetings, the Chairperson may appoint a
           replacement.  If the office of the Chairperson becomes
           vacant between formal meetings, a new Chairperson shall be
           elected by an informal majority vote of the remaining
           officers.  At any formal meeting, any officer, including the
           Chairperson, may be replaced by a simple majority vote of
           the voting members present at that meeting.


      4.3  Chairperson

           4.3.1  The Chairperson is responsible for governing the
           general business of the FST.  He or she is responsible for
           implementing the FST's Charter and any other requirements
           specified by the Standard.

           4.3.2  The Chairperson's term of office shall be from the
           conclusion of the formal meeting at which he or she is
           elected to the conclusion of the next formal meeting.  The
           election of a Chairperson is held at the concluding general
           session of a formal meeting after the election of voting
           members; hence, newly elected voting members may vote for
           the Chairperson.  Only voting members are eligible to be
           elected Chairperson.

           4.3.3  The Chairperson shall conduct each formal meeting.
           In general, the meetings will follow the current Robert's
           Rules of Order; however, the Chairperson may determine the
           specific rules for a formal meeting.

      D.  CHARTER


           4.3.4  Any matter needing a decision between formal meetings
           not specified by this Charter shall be decided by the
           Chairperson.

           4.3.5  The Chairperson has duties and responsibilities
           specified elsewhere in this Charter.


      4.4  Secretary

           4.4.1  The Secretary is responsible for recording the
           activities and results of the FST.

           4.4.2  The Secretary is elected at the first general session
           of a formal meeting and serves until a Secretary is elected
           at the beginning of the next formal meeting.

           4.4.3  The Secretary has many responsibilities.

           4.4.3.1  The Secretary is responsible for collecting,
           maintaining, and archiving the official copies of the
           Standard, the Charter, all other FST documents,
           correspondence, and lists of the FST members of each class.

           4.4.3.2  During a formal meeting, the Secretary is
           responsible for:

                (a)  Keeping the minutes of the general sessions,
                including all votes taken.  For votes affecting the
                Standard or Charter, he or she shall:  record the
                number of voting members present, determine if a quorum
                is present, determine the number of affirmative votes
                required for the vote to pass, the number of voting
                members voting in the affirmative and negative, and the
                result of the vote.

                (b)  Recording and verifying the attendance and
                membership class of each attendee.

                (c)  Recording the recommendations of subteams.

           4.4.3.3  The Secretary is also responsible for collecting,
           archiving, and distributing proposals before a formal
           meeting.  He or she is also responsible for incorporating
           proposals accepted during a formal meeting into the Standard
           or Charter.  Other officers aid the Secretary in these
           duties.

      4.5  Treasurer

           4.5.1  The Treasurer is responsible for managing the
           financial business of the FST.  He or she is responsible for
           maintaining accurate and current financial records and for
           accepting and dispersing funds for official FST activities.



                                     81





      D.  CHARTER


           4.5.2  The Treasurer's term of office shall be from the
           conclusion of the formal meeting at which he or she is
           elected to the conclusion of the next formal meeting.  The
           election of a Treasurer is held just after the election of
           the Chairperson.  Only voting members are eligible to be
           elected Treasurer.


      4.6  Referees

           4.6.1  At the conclusion of a formal meeting there may be
           additional technical work required to prepare a draft
           Standard or Charter.  This work shall be performed by the
           officers of the FST, including a group of Referees.  They
           should be individuals who have superior knowledge and
           experience in the implementation and use of FORTH.

           4.6.2  At least three and no more than five Referees shall
           be elected by a majority of the voting members present at
           the concluding general sessions of a formal meeting.  This
           takes place after the election of voting members.  A
           Referee's term is from election at the end of one formal
           meeting until the end of the next formal meeting.  Only
           voting members are eligible to be elected as Referees.

           4.6.3  The Referees shall adopt methods and rules as they
           deem appropriate to complete their work; they may be
           informal.  However, any matter committed to the Referees for
           resolution must achieve near unanimous agreement (not more
           than one no vote).  Lacking that, the matter shall be
           omitted from further action pending further consideration at
           the next formal meeting.


      5.  EXPERIMENTAL PROPOSALS


      5.1  General

           5.1.1  Since FORTH is an extensible language and subject to
           evolution, the Standard may contain a section describing
           experimental proposal to aid in the analysis of and the
           decision for or against future adoption into the Standard.
           After the results of experimentation are known, each
           proposal will be considered, at a future formal meeting, for
           inclusion into the Standard.

           5.1.2  An experimental proposal may be individual FORTH
           words, sets of related words, or specifications for part of
           the Standard.  Experimental proposals may be derived from
           ordinary proposals or other contributions.






                                     82





      D.  CHARTER


      5.2  Required Information

           Each experimental proposal must contain the following
           minimum information:

           5.2.1  A description of the proposal including an overview
           of its functions and its interactions with existing FORTH
           words.

           5.2.2  A glossary entry of each word in the form and
           notation of the Standard.

           5.2.3  A statement by the author(s) indicating why the
           proposal meets inclusion into the Standard.  Both advantages
           and disadvantages should be discussed.


      5.3  Suggested Information

           It is suggested that each experimental proposal also
           include:

           5.3.1  A source definition for each word in the proposal.
           High level definitions using Standard words are preferred,
           but new primitive words may be defined in an assembly
           language of one commonly-known processor.  Sufficient
           documentation should be provided so that implementation on
           other processors is direct.

           5.3.2  An example showing usage of the new words.


      6.  VOTING


      6.1  General

           Only voting members have the right to vote on proposals
           affecting the Standard, a draft Standard, or this Charter.


      6.2  Advisory Votes

           At the discretion of the Chairperson, advisory votes may be
           requested at a formal meeting.  At the discretion of the
           Chairperson, all attendees may participate in an advisory
           vote.


      6.3  Method

           Any vote at a formal meeting may be by show of hands or, at
           the discretion of the Chairperson, by an informal secret
           paper ballot or a roll call.



                                     83





      D.  CHARTER


      6.4  Number

           A vote to adopt a proposal into the draft Standard or to
           change the Standard, except for the Experimental Proposals
           section of the Standard requires a two-thirds affirmative
           vote of the voting members present at a general session of a
           formal meeting, provided that the number of votes cast are
           at least two thirds of that morning's quorum count.  To
           adopt an experimental proposal into the Experimental
           Proposals section of the draft Standard or to change this
           Charter, an affirmative vote of a simple majority is
           required.  Accepting any other procedural matter at a formal
           meeting requires only a simple majority affirmative vote.


      6.5  Proxies

           All votes must be cast by the particular voting member
           eligible to vote.  No proxy voting is allowed.

              Proposal and Comment Submittal Form Instructions

      Please use the supplied forms for your entire proposal.  The
      continuation form is only to be used if absolutely necessary; try
      to get your proposal to fit on the first sheet.  If it helps, use
      a reducing copy machine to get more material onto the first
      sheet.  If you must use multiple sheets, put the main idea onto
      the first sheet and less important material onto continuation
      sheets.  Remember that material on continuation sheets may be
      overlooked.

      The proposal forms have been produced on a computer system so
      that you may produce your proposals using your own computer
      system.  If you print your proposal and form on your computer
      system, all of the information shown on the form(s) MUST be
      printed and in the same location.

      The following are the instructions for each of the areas of the
      form:

      1.   Please think of the most appropriate keyword or keywords
           describing your proposal.

      2.   Select the best of the following categories of proposals:
           0    Nucleus Layer other than #1 (i.e., +  AND )
           1    Memory Operations (i.e., @  CMOVE )
           2    Dictionary (i.e., '  FORGET )
           3    String Operations (i.e., WORD  COUNT )
           4    Interpreter Layer other than #2 or #3 (i.e., ABORT  . )
           5    Compiler Layer (i.e., :  DO )
           6    Device Layer (i.e., BLOCK  TYPE )
           7    Experimental (i.e., 32-bit stack entries)
           8    Other Technical (i.e., mono-addressing)
           9    Charter

      3.   Mark whether this is a PROPOSAL or a COMMENT.

      4.   Indicate which FORTH word or words are relevant.

      5.   Indicate which section or sections of the Standard are
           relevant.

      6.   The abstract must be kept short.  The title, keywords,
           category, and abstract may be used in a database for
           organization and display on a terminal during a Standards
           Team meeting.

      7.   Detail your proposal and provide supporting discussion.

      8.   Indicate the name of the submitter or the names of the
