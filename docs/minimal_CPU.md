There are many essay about minimal CPU and so on, this is more one.

Define a CPU with only 4 registers and a program counter. A work register (W), a hold register (N), a address register (A) and a operation register (T). 

For this model the op-codes are:

| op code | bits | operation |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| nop | 0 0 0 0 | W -> W | move contents of W to W |
