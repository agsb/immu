# immu

An implementation of Forth with inner interpreter using extended indirect thread code and a dictionary made of machine independent vocabularies. 
  
_Only the inner interpreter and vocabularies related to systems, drives and primitives are machine dependent._

The extended indirect thread code (EITC) gives to Forth inner interpreter the decision of when use "pull and push" or "jump and link".
