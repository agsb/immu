# immu

An implementation of Forth with inner interpreter using minimal thread code and (__maybe__) a dictionary made of machine independent vocabularies. 
  
_Only the inner interpreter and vocabularies related to systems, drives and primitives are machine dependent._

The minimal Thread Code [MITC](https://github.com/agsb.github.io) gives to Forth inner interpreter the decision of when use "push and pull" or "jump and link".

More information in [Details](https://github.com/agsb/immu/blob/main/Details.md)

In 2023, the immu Forth was splitted for ISAs: 6502, Atmega328, RiscV

For Atmega328, still not ported, see some code at https:github.com/agsb/f2u

I'm requesting for comments about immu, an minimal thread code for forth. 

I welcome your patience.
