A Forth with minimal indirect thread code

(S: w1 w2 w3 -- w1 w3) parameter stack, before -- after, w3 at top
(R: w1 w2 w3 -- w1 w3) return stack, before -- after, w3 at top

simetric division, floored to zero

// RISCV considerations 

Using R32IM, 32 bits cell, 

must be saved by subroutines (calee)

( a PDP-11 )
s4 ~X20~ as Rsp, return stack pointer
s5 ~X21~ as Psp, parameter stack pointer
s6 ~X22~ as Lnk, Link pointer, reserved  
s7 ~X23~ as Top, Top on stack, reserved
s8 ~X24~ as Nos, Next on stack, when need
s9 ~X25~ as Wrk, temporary scratch register

( extras )
s10 ~X26~ as T0, temporary extra
s11 ~X27~ as T1, temporary extra

Why T0 and T1 ? 

To make easy memmov, memcpy.
A mem needs five registers 
two for address sources, two for contents bytes, 
and maybe a counter.
else many stack operations are need
